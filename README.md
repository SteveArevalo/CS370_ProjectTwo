# CS370_ProjectTwo

### Project Summary

For this project, I was given a set of prewritten `.py` files that contained the foundational components of the Treasure Hunt game, including the environment setup, state management, and helper functions for rendering and reward calculation. My task was to complete the **Q-Training Algorithm section** within the Jupyter Notebook (`TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`). This involved developing the code that allowed the intelligent agent (the pirate) to learn how to reach the treasure using **Deep Q-Learning**. Specifically, I implemented the logic for training the neural network model, updating Q-values, managing exploration versus exploitation, and applying experience replay. I also ensured that my implementation followed industry best practices by using in-line comments and structuring the code for readability and maintainability.

### Connection to Computer Science

Throughout this course, I learned how artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning fit into the broader field of computer science. Computer scientists focus on solving complex problems through computation—designing algorithms, creating models, and developing systems that can learn, adapt, and optimize over time. Their work matters because it drives innovation in nearly every field, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, by automating processes and uncovering insights that would be impossible to achieve manually.

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I’ve learned to break it down into smaller, manageable components. I start by clearly defining the problem, understanding the data and constraints, researching possible algorithms, and then implementing, testing, and refining my solution. This systematic, iterative approach helps ensure efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

Ethically, as a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to both the end user and the organization. This means ensuring that the systems I design are **safe, transparent, and fair**, without causing harm or bias. It’s important to respect user privacy, protect data integrity, and make design decisions that align with ethical and societal values. In this project, that translates to creating AI that behaves predictably, learns effectively, and operates within the bounds of its intended purpose.
